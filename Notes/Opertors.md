**Operators**
***
In C# we have 4 types of operators:

1• Arithmetic: used for computations
        +, -, *, /, %
        Incremental Operator
            Postfix Increment: 
                int a = 1; int b = a++;
                b initial value is 1 then increment to 2;
            Prefix Increment:
                int a = 1; int b = ++a;
                b initial value is 2;

2• Comparison: used for comparing values in boolean expressions
        ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
3• Assignment: user for assigning values to variable
        =, +=, -=, *=, /=
4• Logical: represent logical AND, OR and NOT
        &&, ||, !
4• Bitwise: represent bitwise AND, OR and NOT
        &, Or : 
        Used in low level programming like workig with Windows API or in sockets or encryption
